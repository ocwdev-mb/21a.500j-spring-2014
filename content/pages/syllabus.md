Course Description
------------------

This 9-unit subject examines relationships among technology, culture, and politics in a range of social and historical settings. Does technology save us work? Improve our health? Ameliorate social inequality? We organize this class around two topics: Identity and infrastructure. How does thinking of our bodies and selves as technologies shape our ideas and experiences of cultural and personal identity? How are politics built into our infrastructures, from roads to electricity grids to the Internet and beyond? We will be interested in whether technology has produced a better world, and for whom.

Classes will combine interactive lectures, film screenings, and discussion. Each class is keyed to a set of readings, and it is crucial that students keep up with the readings and be prepared to discuss them in class. Some lectures will directly engage our readings while others will provide contextualizing historical and theoretical information. We will routinely break into small groups for more concentrated discussion. Class participation will count strongly towards the final grade.

We expect students to adhere to MIT's guidelines on academic integrity. Plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration, cheating, or facilitating academic dishonesty may cause us to contact the [Office of Student Conduct](https://studentlife.mit.edu/osc) or [Committee on Discipline](http://web.mit.edu/committees/cod/). If you have questions about what qualifies as plagiarism and how to avoid it—and for tips on how to succeed—check out: [Academic Integrity at MIT: A Handbook for Students](http://integrity.mit.edu/).

Requirements
------------

Students will write two 6–7 page papers (1800 words or so). Each represents one third of the subject grade. Papers correspond to two thematic sections of the syllabus and will integrate class readings with a topic of each student's choosing. Students will also be evaluated on class participation, including discussion and in-class writing exercises (one third of subject grade). Punctual attendance is obligatory. There is no final.

Students are expected to attend class, complete all assigned readings (approximately 60–90 pages a week) and actively participate in class discussion, which will incorporate readings as well as project assignments. Readings and assignments are to be completed by the session indicated in the {{% resource_link 04ba1481-ae37-c6fb-2ade-744c60dd5366 "Readings" %}} table.

Please bring to class the required readings for each session—a book, or printed hard copies or electronic versions of the articles. You will need these to participate in class discussion, complete in-class exercises, and perform group activities.
